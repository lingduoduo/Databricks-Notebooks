    "## Objective\n",
    "Your assignment is to design, build, and explain a novel agentic workflow that utilizes a subset of the Wikipedia dataset. As part of this, you will need to define a distinctive GenAI use case that your system is intended to solve. The aim is to showcase not just your technical implementation skills, but also your ability to apply agentic system design innovatively and practically. You will implement your workflow in the Databricks Free Edition, starting from the provided notebook `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, we pre-installed LangChain and LangGraph which are open source GenAI orchestration frameworks that work well in a Databricks workspace. In addition, we have provided you with a basic setup to access the data source using a LangChain dataloader (https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/wikipedia/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use coding assistants for this assignment, but you must provide your own custom prompts and demonstrate your own critical thinking. Large language models must not be used to generate responses for the open-response questions in Part B of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This assignment uses serverless clusters. At the time of creating this notebook, all components run successfully. However, you may need to address package dependency issues in the future to ensure your GenAI solution continues to function properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reference Architecture\n",
    "    - This should highlight your approach to addressing your use case or problem in either a pdf or image format; include technical agentic workflow details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Databricks Notebook(s)\n",
    "    - Includes primary notebook `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview`.ipynb and any supplemental notebooks required to run the agent\n",
    "    - In the `01_agentic_wikipedia_aimpoint_interview`.ipynb notebook complete the **GenAI Application Development** and **Reflection** sections. The GenAI Application Development section is where you add your own custom logic to create and run your agentic workflow. The Reflection section is writing a markdown response to answer the two questions.\n",
    "    - To reduce your development time, we created the logic for you to have a FAISS vector store and made the LLM accessible as well.\n",
    "    - Before finalizing, make sure your code runs correctly by using \"Run All\" to validate functionality. Then go to \"File\" → \"Export\" → \"HTML\" to download as HTML file. Next, open this HTML file. Finally save as a PDF see instructions below. __Note: In your submissions this must be a PDF file format__\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Save HTML as PDF**\n",
    "    > - Windows: (ctrl + P) → Save as PDF → Save\n",

    "## Data Source\n",
